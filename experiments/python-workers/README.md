# Python Workers feasibility spike

This runs Pyodide 0.28.3 (CPython 3.13.2, Emscripten ABI `2025_0`) inside an
unmodified celld 0.5.1 binary. It exercises actual HTTP requests, KV, and outbound
fetch. It is **not** native `.py` deployment support or the Cloudflare Python SDK.

## Reproduce

From this directory:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm run build
CELLD_BIN=/absolute/path/to/celld-0.5.1 npm test
```

Without `CELLD_BIN`, the test uses `../../.celld/tools/celld`. The first run's
task-local Apple Silicon release binary came from
https://github.com/denoland/celld/releases/download/v0.5.1/celld-aarch64-apple-darwin.gz
and its decompressed SHA-256 is
`88ab836fc6aa75c23c446abe2e207bb09f25c8bf47e661b3c1bcbb2b2e858da4`.
Use the appropriate official release artifact on another platform.

Tests start their own celld process group and local outbound HTTP endpoint,
allocate isolated local storage, and stop those processes afterward. Runtime
assets are bundled; startup does not fetch Pyodide or the stdlib from a CDN.
The explicitly requested outbound fetch in the test goes only to loopback.
Dependencies are pinned by `package-lock.json`.

`results/smoke.json` records timing samples and node RSS before/after requests.
RSS includes the whole node and KV work, so its difference is not a clean
per-interpreter allocation measurement. Cold timing starts after celld announces
readiness, excluding process startup and compiled-Wasm registration. This is a
smoke measurement, not a comparative performance benchmark.

## Adapter boundaries

- `worker.py` uses Pyodide's `js` FFI and a fixture-specific handler. It does not
  yet implement `from workers import WorkerEntrypoint`.
- `runtime-assets.js` gives the generated bundle lexical worker-environment
  shims. Host `process`, `self`, `fetch`, and `WebAssembly` are not replaced.
- Pyodide's Emscripten factory registers its ordinary `_createPyodideModule`
  global inside the isolate. This needs cleanup/design review for production.
- The interpreter is a celld compiled-Wasm import; its mutable memory belongs
  to an instance. The stdlib zip is embedded in JS for this fixture only.
- Async Wasm compile/instantiate is temporarily implemented with synchronous
  V8 constructors plus JS promises. The initial native-async attempt stalled;
  a minimized regression and proper host task-pumping investigation remain.
- Initialization is lazy and cached per adapter instance, including failure.
- The callable PyProxy stays alive with the runtime. Returned Python futures
  are destroyed after settlement. Leak resistance still needs a long-run test.
- Detailed initialization errors are returned by this diagnostic fixture.
  That is not the proposed production error-response policy.

## Known failure and fix

The initial bundle selected Emscripten's shell environment. Its entropy path
then attempted `os.system`, leaving CPython initialization incomplete and
causing a later `memory access out of bounds` error. The identical generated
bundle reproduced under Node. Lexically selecting the worker environment uses
`crypto.getRandomValues` and lets the original HTTP repro pass.

## Remaining gates

Workerd differential comparison; real Workers SDK entrypoint; execution limits
and post-termination behavior; memory growth/pressure; proxy leak testing;
runtime/package security and reproducibility review; native packaging/dev UX;
Python Durable Object lifecycle and persistence. No production compatibility
claim follows from this spike.

Pyodide is MPL-2.0. Dependencies and generated artifacts remain external or
ignored; this directory contains the original adapter, build scripts, and
fixtures. Preserve the upstream source/license obligations when designing
runtime redistribution.
